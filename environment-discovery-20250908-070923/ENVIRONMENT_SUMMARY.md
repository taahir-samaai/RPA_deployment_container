## Key Components Discovered

### System Information
- OS and kernel details
- Hardware specifications
- Installed packages

### Container Architecture
- **RPA Containers Found:** rpa-worker1
rpa-worker2
rpa-orchestrator

### RPA System Directory Structure
Based on discovery, your RPA system appears to be located at:
- `/root/rpa-system/` - Main RPA system directory

Key components found:
- Configuration files in `configs/` directory
- Container definitions in `containers/` directory  
- Scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Data volumes in `volumes/` directory
- Python automation modules

### Network Configuration
- Podman networks and bridges
- Port mappings and routing
- Active listening services

### Storage and Volumes
- Volume mounts and bind mounts
- Data persistence locations
- File permissions and ownership

### Build Context
- Source code locations
- Container build files
- Dependencies and requirements

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **Review Configuration Files:**
   - Check `config/files/` directory
   - Verify environment variables and secrets
   - Update URLs and endpoints for production

2. **Prepare Container Images:**
   - Review build context in `source/` directory
   - Build and tag images for production
   - Set up image registry if needed

3. **Network Planning:**
   - Review network configuration in `network/`
   - Plan production network topology
   - Configure firewall rules

4. **Data Migration:**
   - Review volume mounts in `volumes/`
   - Plan data migration strategy
   - Set up backup and recovery procedures

5. **Resource Planning:**
   - Review system specifications in `system/`
   - Size production VM appropriately
   - Plan for monitoring and scaling

## Important Notes

- **Secrets and Passwords:** Review all configuration files for hardcoded secrets
- **IP Addresses:** Update any hardcoded IP addresses for production environment  
- **File Paths:** Verify all file paths work in production environment
- **Permissions:** Ensure proper user and group permissions in production
- **Dependencies:** Install all required packages and dependencies
